Water Warden: A Solar-Powered Buoy for Ocean Trash Detection ðŸŒŠ
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Water Warden, our innovation project designed to tackle the growing problem of ocean pollution. Water Warden is a solar-powered buoy equipped with sensors and a camera to detect trash and provide valuable data for researchers. Our goal is to create a low-cost, open-source solution that helps identify pollution hotspots and enables faster cleanup efforts.

Features
Solar-Powered: Sustainable and efficient power management for long-term operation.
ESP32 Camera: Captures images of floating trash for identification.
Sensors: Tracks water quality (pH, turbidity) and environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure).
GPS Integration: Logs location and time for data accuracy.
Open-Source Design: Built with Arduino IDE and open to contributions from the global community.
Why Water Warden?
Only 5% of the ocean has been thoroughly explored, yet pollution affects ecosystems worldwide.
Water Warden helps detect trash before it breaks down, saving time and resources for cleanup efforts.
This repository includes the code, schematics, and design documentation to build and customize your own Water Warden. Whether you're a researcher, student, or hobbyist, join us in making a difference for our oceans! ðŸŒŽ
